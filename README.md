### Greetings, Traveler. My name is Allen Elzayn.

You find yourself at the entrance of **The Labyrinth of Logic**, a maze woven from pure reason and paradox. I am the architect of this place. Only those who can navigate its challenges may prove their worth.

Before you lie two doors, each marked with a cryptic statement. One leads to the heart of the labyrinth, the other to an endless loop of confusion.

### **The First Trial: The Liar's Doors**

ðŸšª **Door Alpha:** "The statement on the other door is true."
ðŸšª **Door Beta:** "The statement on this door is false."

One door speaks the truth, the other lies. Which door will you choose?
