### Greetings, Traveler. My name is Allen Elzayn.

You find yourself at the entrance of **The Labyrinth of Logic**, a maze woven from pure reason and paradox. I am the architect of this place. Only those who can navigate its challenges may prove their worth.

Before you lie two doors, each marked with a cryptic statement. One leads to the heart of the labyrinth, the other to an endless loop of confusion.

---

### **The First Trial: The Liar's Doors**

ðŸšª **Door Alpha:** "The statement on the other door is true."
ðŸšª **Door Beta:** "The statement on this door is false."

One door speaks the truth, the other lies. Which door will you choose?

### A flicker of light, and you are back where you started.

The door you chose leads to a path that twists back upon itself. The logic was flawed. The architect's voice echoes, *"A paradox unresolved is a loop eternal. Think again."*

Before you lie the same two doors. A new choice awaits.

### The door swings open, revealing a path forward.

Correct. Your logic was sound. The paradox was resolved, and the way is now clear. But be warned, the challenges ahead will only grow more complex.

**[This is where the next puzzle will go. To be continued!]**
